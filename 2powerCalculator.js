/*
2. Power Calculator
Write a function called powerCalculator() that takes two parameters, 
an integer as a base, 
and another integer as an exponent. 
The function returns the value of the base raised to the power 
of the exponent. Use only exponents greater than or equal to 0 (positive numbers)

powerCalculator(10,2) should return 100
powerCalculator(10,-2) should return exponent should be >= 0


What is the input to the program?
an integer as a base, and another as an exponent

What is the output of the program?
The value of the base raised to the power of the exponent

What is the input to each recursive call?

What is the output of each recursive call?
